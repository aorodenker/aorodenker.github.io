# [GymX5000](https://github.com/Slytherin-Blue-Ocean/GymX5000)
GymX5000 is a fitness app that brings health, fitness and a fun video game aspect to living a healthy lifestyle, providing users with an all in one experience where you can stay motivated, eat healthy, get stronger, and compete with friends.  This app uses a multipurpose card system that dynamically renders many different activties from a polymorphic postgreSQL database. GymX5000 includes a unique challenge feature that contains interactable 3D models of trophies that are awarded upon completing tasks.

This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an external user, Chad. As a team, we decided to build the database in a polymorphic design where more categories could be easily added in future updates. With a short period of time, we narrowed down the features to the top must haves of the client to meet a very short deadline. Meet the team who made this possible!

## App User Interface

### Activities
The activities page displays a list of cards where a user can filter the cards by category and further search through them by tag using the search bar.
Near the top of the page is a random motivational quote that changes everytime you refresh the page. Each card can be favorited by clicking the star icon and are added to the profile page upon click. Clicking a cards title will take you to another page displaying more information about that card.

### Classes
In the classes section is a carousel of favorited classes and a list of classes a user has booked and completed.  Below that is a list of upcoming classes you can also book that are not in your favorites list.  Pressing the 'Book' button will show a prompt verifying that you have booked a class.  At the moment, there is no way to delete classes or unbook them. This feature will be added in a future update.

### Challenges
The challenges page showcases a display of 3D interactive badges that can be earned by completing challenges.  Beneath it is a leaderboard that displays the top users who have earned the most points by completing challenges, a feature not yet implemented. Challenges for the month can be found at the bottom of the page where clicking on one will take you to a page with more information about that challenge.  The points system and challenge information will be implemented in a future update.

## Back-End Structure
This is a database structure in which all classes, recipes, and workouts data are linked and managed through an activity table that serves as a great hub. The database is built in such a way that future implementations can be easily added by adding a relationship between the new table and activities table. Thanks to this structure, we are able to consolidate all of the different features (i.e. recipes, workouts, classes) into a single GET request, thus allowing the front end team to create many different activities through a single card component.
