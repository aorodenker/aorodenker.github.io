# [Cowardly Dogs](https://github.com/CowardlyDogs/fec)
Cowardly Dogs is the front end for an interactive, responsive e-commerce web app, featuring a product overview, related items, user-decided outfit section, reviews, and Q&A.

This project was a brief 2-week sprint where our team completed an MVP for Cowardly Dogs. As a team, we decided to split the app into smaller components for each team member allowing for separation of concerns. Our implementation of reusable code allows for more categories to be easily added in future updates.
